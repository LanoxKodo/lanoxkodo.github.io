              <p>People know me as a tech junkie of a sort, I love technology in every aspect! People know I identify more as a furry than anything else to which I'm thankful for those that don't scrutinize me for. People know I have a fondness for gaming and modding, especially if I can share those moments with others.<br>But sometimes not all is ever known, as such I always say that I am an open book for any question you might have.</p>
              <p>But if there is one thing I don't think I've ever made clear, everything I do isn't just due to a spark of wanting to show things off. Nay, rather it's all out of the intent to make everyone excited and thrilled with whatever I can show around. I want to create memories with people that they will cherish and will take forward in life with optimism to try something new. I dabble around with a lot of stuff when I'm not gaming, often these projects are talked about because I want others to know even if you are known as someone with a single interest, you can have a mind that runs wild, and free. Creating memories are what I look for so when we all look back we can have a good historical point to smile and crack a joke about. I admire all the friends I can have around and I hope to see that others around me too feel like they have friends they can be happy with.<p>

            <div class="contentParagraphText">
              <p>I cannot express how thankful I am to have the friends around me at this time and for those I will one day meet. With each passing moment I am thrilled to move forward into tomorrow to work on exciting endeavors and have laughs with people out elsewhere on our home planet.</p>
              <p>I sincerely thank everyone whom continues to be a part of my life, each one of you continue to contribute the best of yourselves in being a part of my life to which I in turn can share what I can do make everyone smile. You all are the most kind I could ask for and I hope we all can walk looking forward into the future with smiles as we move about out there!</p>

And with that I shall see you when dawn breaks for when we can hang out in a game or vc or whatever else we choose! :)</p><p>Sincerely from your fox friend,<br>Lanox Kodo</p>
